Revision history for Perl extension Date::LastModified.

0.60  Mon May 20 19:36:49 2003
    - Deleted DATELASTMODCFG environment variable from module
    - Added DLMUPCFG environment variable to dlmup
    - Added SQLite driver (tested with SQLite V2.8.0)
    - Includes sqlite-2.8.0-os.h.patch to patch DBD::SQLite os.h
      so it will compile under Cygwin with gcc V2.95.3
    - "make test" now calls "perl test-dlmup.pl" to test dlmup
      if module tests all ran OK
    - Added "SQL92" pseudo-entry for DBI that should have the
      correct syntax for SQL92-compliant databases like Oracle9i
    - Started changes for testing any two databases -- test.pl
      code still should only work for Oracle and MySQL for now
    - Fixed MANIFEST so that all necessary files are present
    - Added TODO
    - Updated email for home email address
    - NOTE: UNTESTED on Oracle and MySQL as I don't have those
      databases loaded at home
